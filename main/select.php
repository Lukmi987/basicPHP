             * we will extract the data for each rows in the query result.
             * for this tutorial, we are using the mysqli_fetch_assoc($queryResult) to fetch data as an
             * association in each rows.
             * mysqli_fetch_assoc($queryResult) will return data that are stored as and array of associations. this association array can only be accessed by using association method.
             * you can also use mysqli_fetch_array($queryResult) to return data that are stored as an array itself. this array can be accessed by any method, including association
             *
             * there are many ways to access array data in PHP, some of them is:
             * --> retrieving data by association: $row["studId"]. Name(association) of column are used.
             * --> retrieving data by index: $row[0]. index number of columns are used.
